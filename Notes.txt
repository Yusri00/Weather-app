1. Weather from my current location(sub-functionalities)
2. Search bar
3. Favorites
4. Time related based on location
5. 5-day weather forecast




1.  A function that implements Geolocation returns the city
    Function that accepts cityname and returns latitute and longitude
    Function that fetches the weatherdata using latitude and longitude and returns json-functionalities

2. We need a user input that accepts city (we use the old function that takes cityname and returns latitude + longitude)
    
3. A button that add or remove favorite cities. It needs to save the cityname only.
    If i click add to favorite save cityname by latitude and longitude.
    When cityname is clicked to be displayed it should only fetch weatherdata - faster

4. Based on latitude and longitude we show the time (gmt). See options online.

5. Modify number one, instead of showing the currentweather only. Fetch for 5 days. Read documentation.
    Sketch how it should look.
